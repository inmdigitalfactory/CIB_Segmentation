# CIB_Segmentation
This project's aim is to segment CIB customers by similar characteristics
This analysis presents a comprehensive analysis of the BL01 & BL04 corporate customer base, aiming to segment clients into distinct groups based on their financial behavior and relationship with the bank. By examining transactional, demographic, revenue, and loan data for the year 2022, we have identified three main clusters: High, Medium, and Low value customers.
High value customers represent the most financially active and loyal segment, with the longest average relationship with the bank (10 years) and the highest average transactional values for both credit and debit transactions. Although they comprise the smallest group with a total population of 636, they maintain the highest average monthly balance and account for the largest loan uptake in terms of total loan amount.
Medium value customers form the largest segment with a total population of 993. They exhibit moderate financial activity and maintain a relatively shorter average relationship with the bank (8.2 years). These customers have a significant presence in the bank's loan books and represent a substantial portion of the bank's revenue.
Low value customers, while accounting for a moderate share of the customer base with a total population of 783, demonstrate the least financial activity and have the shortest average relationship with the bank (6.9 years). They maintain the lowest average monthly balance and have the lowest loan uptake among the three groups
